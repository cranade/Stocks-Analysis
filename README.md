# Analysis of Various Stocks

## Chandrashekhar G. Ranade

### Overview of the Project

Steve'ss parents are seeking alternative investment possibilities in the area of alternate energy such as hydro, geothermal, wind and bio, because of their concern about the fossil fuels and their impact on the climate change. They would like Steve to help them to make a decision on which stocks they should focus on to achieve this objective.

Actually Steve's parents have done research and found DAQO New Energy Corporation to be attractive since the corporation produces solar panels. Steve wants to do a further research using the data set he has for 2017 and 2018 and help his parents in making a right decision.

He would like to us Visual Basic Application (VBA) and prepare summary tables to look at the return on the stocks of various corporation for 2017 and 2018. Steve is savvy in excel but, on his request, this project is intended to help him.

### Results

Because of the code provided for the project, it was relatively easy to insert additional codes required to complete this task. The following is the result for years 2017 and 2018

**Return on Stocks**: Looking at the charts for 2017 and 2018 one notices that the return declined substantially for DQ from 199.4% to a negative of -62.6%. The returns are positive only for ENPH and RUN both are green corporations. Therefore I will suggest Steve to strongly advice his parents to reconsider investment in DQ and consider investment in ENPH and RUN.

**Execution time** for the original script was 0.5625 seconds, which much more than that for refactored script which was 0.1015625 seconds.

**Advantages of Refactoring code**: When the original code is reorganized it is called refactoring script.  One advantage of refactored script for this project is that is we see returns in percentages and that too with red and green colors where red is for negative returns while green is for positive returns. However, we could achieved this result in the original code too. There is no disadvantage that one notices with refactoring VBA script. Refactoring script looks well organized.

**Disadvantages of Refactoring code** could be potentially we could introduce bugs which we will not notice. Literature survey raises such caution
